Imagine your boss giving you a following brief for creating this game:

Create a simple guess the number type game.  It should choos a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns.  After each turn the player should be told if they are right or wrong, and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high.  It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed.  The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns.  When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.

Broken down into actionable tasks pseudocode:

- 100% Choose a random number between 1 and 100
- 80% there will be 10 turns  // record the turn number the player is on.  start at 1


- 20% each turn state whether right or wrong  // provide the player with a away to guess what the number is
- 0% if wrong, state too low or too high


- 0% show numbers (record it somewhere) the player previously guessed // Check whether it is the correct number

See number 6 online

- 50% the game ends once the player guesses correctly or once they run out of turns

- 80% when game ends player should have option to start playing again
